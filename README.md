# Project 2 - *NewYorkTimeSearch*

**NewYorkTimeSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **40** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [ ] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [ ] Begin Date (using a date picker)
